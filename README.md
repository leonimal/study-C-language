# study C language

This repository contains some of the first exercises I wrote in the C programming language when I was just starting college. The main goal is to document my learning process and progress in programming.

- About
These exercises cover fundamental C programming concepts, such as:

Input and output (scanf, printf)

Conditional statements (if, else, switch)

Loops (for, while, do-while)

Basic math operations

Arrays and matrices

Simple functions


- Organization
Files are organized by topic or learning phase. Some filenames may be simple or numbered, as they were mainly created for practice purposes.
